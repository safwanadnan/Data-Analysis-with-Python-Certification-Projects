# Data Analysis with Python Certification Projects

Welcome to the **Data Analysis with Python Certification Projects** repository. Here, you will find the solutions for the certification projects included in the **Data Analysis with Python** course offered by freeCodeCamp.

## Course Overview

Data Analysis has been around for a long time. However, recent developments in Python, SQL, and other open libraries have transformed Data Analysis, making it more accessible and powerful than ever before.

In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you will learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you will be proficient in reading data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and adept at using libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

## Courses Included

### Data Analysis with Python

In these comprehensive video courses, created by Santiago Basulto, you will learn the whole process of data analysis. You'll be reading data from multiple sources (CSV, SQL, Excel), process that data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook course, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

### Numpy

Learn the basics of the NumPy library in this video course created by Keith Galli. In this course, you'll learn how NumPy works and how it compares to Python's built-in lists. You'll also learn how to write code with NumPy, indexing, reshaping, applied statistics, and much more.

## Data Analysis with Python Projects
